        The Scavenger Hunt is BACK!

        Join us on September 30th for the 4th Annual Joetown Scavenger Hunt! For
        those that have done this before, you probably know the drill. For those
        who haven't, we'll lay it out for you!

        We'll be meeting up at River Bluff Brewing at 2 PM. From there, you'll
        get a list of "clues" that will guide you and your partner (teams of 2)
        through the hunt. These clues will take you through town stopping at
        local businesses, trail systems, and more! To prove that you've found
        each clue, you MUST take a "selfie" of you and your partner next to the
        clue. The first team back to the brewery with the MOST correct
        clues/pictures wins! Roll out time will be at 3 PM sharp, and you must
        be back to the brewery by 6 PM.

        We'll also be hanging at the brewery afterwards for prizes, raffle
        items, and plenty of beers! Also - there will be a prize for best
        costume!

        Event is FREE for all!

        Remember, teams of 2! Let us know if you don't have a partner, and we'll
        find one for you!

Top Fuel 9.8 is a high-performance full suspension mountain bike for endurance racers and riders who don't settle for one style of riding. It combines the best qualities of XC and trail bikes for an unbelievably fun, efficient, and capable rig. It's fast on flow, shreds big singletrack, and conquers endurance events. The 9.8 is built with an OCLV Mountain Carbon frame and across-the-board parts upgrades, including a 120mm Fox Performance 34 Step-Cast fork, SRAM GX Eagle drivetrain, and carbon wheels and bars.
